# Chapter1# Mechanistic models of antimicrobial resistance transmission between food animals and human populations: A systematic scoping review. 

## Systematic Scoping Review Details

This repository is to store the analysis scripts and data files I have for chapter 1 of my PhD. 

Chapter 1 aims to carry out a systematic scoping review to assess the current state of AMR transmission modelling between livestock and human populations. This was carried out only for mechanistic models.
- Dynamic Epidemiological Models
- Risk Assessment Models

A large excel sheet was created as part of the data-extraction protocol of the systematic scoping review. Two files were created as part of this procedure, an ```.xlsx``` file, 1) ```Lit Review Analysis.xlsx``` and a cut down ```.csv``` file format, which was uimported into RStudio for use in the data analysis 2) ```New_List_noresidue_data.csv```. The RStudio file ```Lit Review Analysis.R``` was used to produce all figures and conduct all data analysis in chapter 1.
